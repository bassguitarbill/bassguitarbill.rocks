				<h2>Mega Man 3</h2>
				<p><em>Nintendo Entertainment System, 1990</em></p>
			</div>

		<div id="content" style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
			<p>Everyone's got their own favorite Mega Man game. 
			Some like the timeless charm and wicked soundtrack of Mega Man 1.
			Some prefer the updated format and memorable enemies of Mega Man 2.
			Some people even like Mega Man 4. I'm not sure why.</p>
			<p>Mega Man 3, though, stands out to me as the best in the series. 
			As the only game with a slide function but not a chargeable buster, MM3 hits the sweet spot of technique and simplicity.
			It introduced Rush, Proto Man, stages between Robot Masters and Dr. Wily, and the grand tradition of easily-guessed plot twists.</p>
			<p>I strongly recommend this third installment to anyone looking to try this series.
			Its difficulty hits a sweet spot: the robot masters are easy if you have their weakness, hard if you don't; 
			the Doc Robot stages provide a challenging all-weapons warm-up before Wily's Castle is unlocked;
			and there are no real "walls" that can stop new players dead in their tracks (lookin' at you, MM2 Wily 4).</p>
			<p>I picked this game up as a speedgame because it seemed the easiest to speedrun.
			Mega Man 1 and 2 have numerous precise glitches that are all but required for speedrunning them,
			while 4, 5, and 6 feature Buster charging, which is a mechanic with which I've never had much skill.
			While I'm pretty sure I made the right choice, MM3 is in no way an easy game to speedrun.
			The game is very optimized, and there's always another trick to learn or another slide to master.</p>

			<p>The data above are collected from the <a href="http://megamanleaderboards.net/index.php?game=3&category=258">Mega Man RTA Leaderboards</a>, and are presented as a rough sketch illustrating the approximate spread of runners.</p>
			<p>The top of the graph is <a href="https://twitch.tv/fastatcc">fastatcc</a>'s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fastatcc/v/73842357">34:04</a>. The orange line corresponds to 37:30. This encompasses the top 30 or so players, and would obviously be a top-tier time. I don't have aspirations, at this point, of making it to that level.</p>
			<p>The green line, however, represents 41 minutes. This looks like the point before a pretty severe drop-off, which is generally the point where you've crossed from "fast casual play" to "actual speedrun". 41 doesn't seem like an unattainable goal.</p>
			<p>That little purple circle is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bassguitarbill/v/73054568">me</a>. Discounting a couple of outliers, I'm definitely bringing up the rear. I have many different things to work on in order to improve that time, and the only way to improve, at this point, is to practice.</p>
